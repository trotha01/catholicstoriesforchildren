The name comes from the Latin word for Angel and the prayer itself reminds us of how Jesus Christ assumed our human nature through the Mystery of the Incarnation. The Pope recites the Angelus prayer in St Peterâ€™s Square every Sunday at midday. It concludes with the recitation of the Gloria three times. Source: "
